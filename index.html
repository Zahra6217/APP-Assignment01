                <p>The now destroyed <strong>Buddhas</strong>  were once a historic example of colossal Buddhist cave architecture 
                in the Bamyan Valley of Afghanistan. 
                The Bamyan Buddhas were two colossal Buddhist statues carved into rock faces in the 
                Bamyan Valley of central Afghanistan 
                during the 6th century. The exceptionally large, totemic statues were an important, 
                partially intact relic of Buddhist cave architecture that had once spread throughout early Asia. 
                 2001, the statues were destroyed by Taliban forces, partly as an act of iconoclasm, 
                and also as defiance against the western finances
                being spent on the statues when the country was facing a humanitarian crisis.</p>

                <p>Their destruction of the statues raised worldwide media attention, 
                and prompted the UNESCO World Heritage Fund to list the remaining site as a 
                World Heritage Site in Danger. 
                Preservation of the site is ongoing today, as UNESCO hope to conserve what is left of the statues and their historical grounds. </p>

                <h2>The Bamyan Buddhas Were Two Giant Sculptures</h2>
                <h3>The <em>Buddhas</em> characteristics </h3>
                <p>Before being destroyed, the Bamyan Buddhas were once among the largest sculptures in the entire world.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The tallest of the two statues was 175 feet high.and art historians believe it represented the Buddha Vairochana.</li> 
                        <li>The smaller of them was 120 feet high, and represented the Buddha Shakyamuni. </li>
                        <li>Both statues demonstrated remarkable carving skills, having been shaped in the round at the head and foot areas. </li>
                        <li>The space around the feet allowed Buddhist worshippers to circulate around the statue while engaging in acts of worship.</li>
